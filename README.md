# MSA Forgery ML Model

## Project Idea

This project is aimed at using machine learning via classification models to determine whether a banknote is authentic or forged. The model itself classifies a banknote as genuine or forged (discrete) based on 4 attributes:
1. Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
2. Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
3. Curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
4. Entropy of image (continuous)

The data in the data set was extracted from images of genuine and forged banknotes, using the Wavelet Transform tool. The original data set is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication#).

## Environment Setup & Dependencies
